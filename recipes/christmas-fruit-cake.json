        "In a large bowl, mix all the dried fruits with the brandy, citrus zests and juices. Cover with clingfilm and leave in a cool place overnight or 24 hours.",
        "Preheat the oven to 140˚C, gas mark 1. Grease a deep 23cm springform cake tin and line with a double layer of parchment paper, to at least 6cm above the sides of the tin. Wrap the tin in a double layer of brown parcel paper (or newspaper) 2-3cm above the sides of the tin; tie with string.",
        "Cream the butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Add the yolk and the eggs, one at a time, beating well with a few tbsp of flour between each. Mix in the remaining ingredients, then fold in the soaked fruit. Spoon into the tin and even out the surface.",
        "Bake for 2 hours until set on top, then cover with 2 circles of parchment paper. Check the cake every 30 minutes until it is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. This will take 3-4 hours or longer, depending on your oven.",
        "Remove from the oven and pierce a dozen holes in the surface. Pour over 3 tbsp of brandy and cool in the tin for 45 minutes. Take out of the tin, transfer to a wire rack, remove the parchment, and leave to cool completely.",
        "Once cool, feed the cake again with more brandy and leave to soak in. Wrap in a double layer of parchment, cover tightly with foil, and continue to feed until needed."
