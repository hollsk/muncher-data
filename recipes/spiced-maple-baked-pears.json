        "Preheat the oven to 200˚C / 180˚C fan. Halve the pears lengthways, leaving the stalk intact on one side. There's no need to remove the core. Lay them cut-side up in a snug-fitting ovenproof dish. Pour the apple juice and maple syrup over the pears, then scatter the remaining ingredients on top.",
        "Bake for 20 minutes, gently flip over the pears, then cook for another 15-20 minutes, until a sharp knife glides in easily and you have a syrupy sauce at the bottom of the dish.",
        "Arrange the pears in a large dish to share or divide between bowls, and drizzle over any remaining syrup. Serve with spoonfuls of soya, coconut, or low-fat yoghurt."
