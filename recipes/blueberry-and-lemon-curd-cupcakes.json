        "Preheat the oven to 180ËšC, gas mark 4. Mix the blueberries in a pan with the lemon zest and juice and 40g caster sugar. Set over a high heat for 4-5 minutes, crushing the fruit roughly, until jammy; set aside.",
        "Line a 12-hole muffin tin with paper muffin cases. Using electric beaters, cream together the remaining 180g caster sugar and the 180g butter until fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating between each addition. Whisk in the buttermilk, then the dry ingredients (not the icing sugar) and a pinch of salt, until well mixed.",
        "Divide 1/2 the cake batter between the cases, then make an indent for the filling. Put 1/2 tsp blueberry compote into the centre of 6 cakes, and 1/2 tsp lemon curd in the rest. Divide the remaining batter between the cases, sealing in the filling. Bake for 20-25 minutes, until golden and a skewer inserted down the side of the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.",
        "For the icing, in a large bowl, slowly beat the 100g butter, 100g icing sugar and a pinch of salt with electric beaters until it starts to come together. Increase the speed and beat for 2-3 minutes until really light and fluffy.",
        "Split the icing between 2 bowls. Ripple the remaining compote through one and the lemon curd through the other. Put into piping bags; snip a 1cm hole off the end. Pipe on the icing, or spread with a palette knife."
