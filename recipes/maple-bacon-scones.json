    "tip": "When rubbing together the butter and flour, keep the butter really cold. Avoid overworking the dough - too much manhandling can make it tough. Scones need a good raising agent, so make sure yours is in date as this can affect its strength. And when cutting out your scones, don't twist the cutter or they'll become lopsided as they bake.",

        "Mix the milk and maple syrup together. Pour into the mixture and, using a knife, roughly bring together. Knead briefly and very lightly to combine, then pat out on a floured surface to about 2.5cm thick. Cut out 6cm rounds using a cookie cutter - reroll any extra dough until you have 6 scones. Place on a lightly floured baking tray. Lightly brush the tops with maple syrup and bake for 18-20 minutes until golden on top.",
        "Cool a little, then split and serve with cheddar and chives."
