        "Preheat the oven to 170ËšC. Roast the nuts for 10 minutes, cool, then roughly chop. Mix the rhubarb with 70g caster sugar and 60ml water, then transfer to a baking tray. Cover tightly with foil and roast for 30-35 minutes until tender. Set aside to cool, then strain. Reserve the liquid in a bowl and mix with the Amaretto. Keep the cooked rhubarb separate.",
        "For the sabayon, put the yolks and 160g caster sugar in a large heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water; the base of the bowl should not touch the water. Using electric beaters, whisk continuously as you pour in the marsala, until the eggs cook; about 10 minutes. Next, whisk over iced water untilcold. Then add the mascarpone and whisk vigourously until smooth. In a separate bowl, whisk the cream and 1tbsp caster sugar to soft peaks.",
        "Cut the sponge into squares roughly 8cm x 8cm, and dip them in the Amaretto and rhubarb cooking juices. Put 1/2 of them in the base of a large glass bowl (about 3 litres). Spoon 1/2 of the rhubarb on top, followed by 1/2 of the sabayon and then 1/2 of the nuts. Follow this with another layer of sponge, then the remaining sabayon and fruit. Top with the whipped cream and sprinkle with the remaining nuts. Chill well before serving."
