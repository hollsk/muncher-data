        "I think she's probably right; it is near impossible to tackle a whole ripe mango without at least a trickle of juice running down your chin. Being in the bath makes the ensuing clean up process much easier.",
        "Mangoes are one of those exotic imports from warmer parts of the world that bring sunshine to our diets at this time of year. Most, I suspect, are eaten simply sliced or cubed, or added to fruit salads and pavlovas - and there's nothing wrong with that. To our Western palates, their perfume suggests sweet alliances. Look further afield though, and you'll find myriad savoury uses.",
        "The flesh works well with many of the same flavours as avocado - particularly southeast Asian-inspired seafood or chicken salads - as well as with avocado itself (try the two together in a salsa for grilled meat) and you can even cook with it. Southern India, for instance, has curries made with mango, coconut, yoghurt, chilli, and curry leaves, which are a delicious mix of sweetness and spice. You don't even have to sit in the bath to eat them."
