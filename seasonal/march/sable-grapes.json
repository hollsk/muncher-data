        "The flavour is distinctively sweet (I'm told they are 15 per cent sweeter than your average table grape) with notes of muscat perfume and a texture that is firm without being crisp. If you don't want to take them along a sweet route (they make a great addition to fruit salads, and jelly), try them as a light lunch with a blob of soft goat's cheese, halving the grapes before piling them with the cheese onto a rustic piece of toast.",
        "Alternatively, throw a handful into a simple salad with feta and leaves, scatter into a classic Waldorf, or use them to add dots of colour and sweetness to a late winter salad of cooked cauliflower, walnuts, and parsely leaves, dressed in the simplest of vinaigrettes."
