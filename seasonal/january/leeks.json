        "Added to, say, a lamb and barley stew or a dish of pot-roast duck legs and prunes, their gentle flavour brings something deeply consoling to the party. Combine them with cream - in creamed leeks to go with a roast chicken, perhaps (I think leeks are particularly good with chicken), or in a simple soup - and they are as soothing as a comfort blanket. Add mustard and cheese, and... well, the joy is pretty much complete. That wonderful Belgian (or is it French?) gratin of cooked leeks wrapped in ham and baked in a mustard and nutmeg-scented cheese sauce is one of the best ways I can think of to forget the inclemencies of the outside world.",
        "That said, I am also deeply partial to a cooked leek served cold - even in winter. Leek salads are what the French used to call ‘poor man's asparagus’ and, treated right, there is indeed something simply luxurious about them. Either poach the leeks ‘à la grecque’ - with wine, lemon, olive oil, bay, thyme, and coriander seeds - until soft and leave them to cool in the liquid, or smother them with something robustly mustardy, such as an unctuous viniagrette, made with a good blob of dijon."
