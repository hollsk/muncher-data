        "This rounded white root, flushed with purple, is often considered comical and in some circles, is a synonym for stupidity: 'Don't be daft, you turnip.' Actually, though, it's rather a good vegetable.",
        "The flavour combines the pepperiness of raw cabbage with a sweeter edge, making it surprisingly versatile. It makes a fine Middle Eastern pickle, for instance, preserved in chunks with garlic and a slice of beetroot to stain it pink. Finely sliced or shredded, it can be used raw in slaws and salads. Smaller turnips are generally best if you are going to use them raw.",
        "Their flavour becomes bolder as they cook. They are typically added to the French winter beef stew, pot au feu, along with onions, carrots, and leeks, though some might argue they are best simply glazed. Poach them in butter, sugar, and stock until tender, then let the liquid reduce to a sticky juice, adding a whisper of white wine vinegar at the end by way of contrast. Done this way, they make a classic accompaniment for roast duck."
